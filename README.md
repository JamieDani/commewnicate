# Goal
Many CS majors and Gen Z students are introverted. This tool can help ease them out of their comfort zone to practice and develop the necessary soft skills they need to advance their career - without the pressure of passing their interview, the stakes of making a good impression, their hackathon prize on the line, or any fear of judgement whatsoever.

# What it does
This platform provides an AI voice agent who will role-play as a hackathon judge, tech professional at a networking event, or your interviewer so you can practice your soft skills! The model's behavior is customizable to the user's situation via text input.

# How it's built
- **React** front-end
- **Retell AI API** for AI voice agent
- **Procreate** for drawings
- **MUI** for components

# Future goals
- **Add feedback**: line by line analysis of tone, confidence, filler words
- **Add predicted outcome**: for example, if they won the prize, passed the interview, or made a good impression
- **Stats over time**: show progress and improvement over the long-term and gain achievements
- **Study body language via a webcam**: more communication is done non-verbally and also important to practice
